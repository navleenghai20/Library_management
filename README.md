This code is written in Postgre SQL for "Library Management System". 
Here, we have created a few tables like book_infor, authors, book_copies and book_issue.

To use this database, you will need to have PostgreSQL installed on your machine.

1. book_infor : This table will store the information about the various books stored in the library database.
3. authors : This table will store the information about the various authors whose books are stored in the library database.
4. book_copies: This table will store the information about the number of copies of all the books stored in the library database.
5. book_issue : This table will store the information about the member_id and due date of all the books issued.
